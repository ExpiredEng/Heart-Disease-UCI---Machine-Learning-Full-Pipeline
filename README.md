# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction – Machine Learning Pipeline  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **comprehensive machine learning pipeline** on the **UCI Heart Disease dataset**.  
The goal is to **analyze, predict, and visualize heart disease risks** using both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.  

The project also includes a **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions, and can be deployed online using **Ngrok**.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- ✅ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning (handle missing values, encoding, scaling)  
- ✅ Dimensionality Reduction with **PCA**  
- ✅ Feature Selection (RFE, Chi-Square, Feature Importance)  
- ✅ Supervised Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM  
- ✅ Unsupervised Learning: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering  
- ✅ Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV)  
- ✅ Model Export (`final_model.pkl`)  
- ✅ Streamlit Web UI for predictions  
- ✅ Deployment via **Ngrok**  
- ✅ Full GitHub Repository with documentation
